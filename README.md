DataCore
A C++ simulation of data processing under resource constraints, mimicking embedded systems like microcontrollers in spaceflight, engineering, and science. Sorts sensor data within a 1 KB memory limit, optimizes efficiency with bubble sort, and ensures reliability through robust input validation and error handling. Tracks performance metricsâ€”comparisons, swaps, and runtimeâ€”for critical applications. ðŸŒŒ
Features

Resource Constraints: Enforces a 1 KB memory limit, simulating embedded environments.
Data Processing: Sorts random sensor readings (0â€“100Â°C) using bubble sort with early termination.
Efficiency: Measures comparisons, swaps, and runtime with std::chrono for performance optimization.
Reliability: Validates user input and handles errors gracefully.
Broad Applicability: Designed for spaceflight (e.g., spacecraft telemetry) but extends to automotive, IoT, and scientific data analysis.

Prerequisites

C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++) supporting C++11 or later.
Standard C++ libraries (<iostream>, <vector>, <random>, <chrono>, <iomanip>, <utility>).

How to Run

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/Benjaminwonder/DataCore.git
cd DataCore


Compile:g++ main.cpp -o datacore


Run:./datacore


Enter the number of sensor readings (e.g., 16 for a small dataset, 300 to test memory limits).

Example Outputs
16 Readings
Welcome to DataCore!
Enter number of sensor readings (e.g., 100): 16
